3.1 - March, 2012 - Allows multiple WYSIWYG editors per block (requires Concrete version 5.5.2); code and files for blocks containing WYSIWYG fields are now much cleaner (because we can finally rely on the core system's helpers); added small optimization to controller_image_helper method so that it uses C5's existing image width/height attributes instead of calling getimagesize().
3.0.2 - January, 2012 - Added legacy image cropping helper so blocktypes generated with older versions of Designer Content still work.
3.0.1 - January, 2012 - Fixed problem when upgrading from older version; reverted old only-one-wysiwyg-editor-per-block functionality due to bugs.
3.0 - December, 2011 - Concrete5.5.0 compatibility; installs to /dashboard/blocks/ instead of dashboard/pages/; added dashboard validation for block handle length; now allowing more than 1 WYSIWYG field per block (some unknown recent change to core code makes this possible).
2.1.3 - December, 2011 - Set generated file permissions if DESIGNER_CONTENT_FILE_CHMOD is set; Added tao's Japanese translation, and we now assign system language setting to tinymce editor_config; Fixed bug with empty images; Removed all whitespace between link tags and their contents in generated view.php; Cleaned up some markup in generated view.php.
2.1.2 - October, 2011 - Fixed bug where dashboard was returning a "table already exists" error even when no such table existed
2.1.1 - October, 2011 - Fixed bug with empty file downloads
2.1 - September, 2011 - Added new German translation, fixed WYSIWYG toolbar layout in 5.4.2, fixed weird line wrap of "required" checkboxes in dashboard interface on wide screens, added special case to external url helper so it works with internal links (if link starts with a slash)
2.0 - June, 2011 - New fields (textarea, file, date, external url, dropdown); more options for image field; character limit option for textbox field; "phantom" database tables from deleted blocks that used the same handle will now be overwritten when generating a new block; cleaner generated code; bug fixes.
1.0.1 - May, 2011 - Added Japanese translation (thanks Tao!), now call strip_tags on the block name/description in dashboard (prior to validation), block generation no longer creates CHANGELOG files, fixed newline output in generated db.xml files.
1.0.0 - March, 2011 - Initial Version
