**THIS IS A BETA VERSION OF DESIGNER CONTENT 2.0 -- NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE!!!**

The current stable release version is available in the Concrete5 marketplace: <http://www.concrete5.org/marketplace/addons/designer-content/>.

Designer Content is an addon for the Concrete5 CMS that provides an easy-to-use dashboard interface for generating custom block types. See the marketplace link above for a more in-depth explanation of what it's used for, as well as thorough end-user documentation (click the "Documentation" link in the sidebar).

#HOW TO INSTALL:
*NOTE: these instructions are for this 2.0 beta version only -- if you're an end-user you should use the marketplace link above.*

1. If you already have an older version of Designer Content installed, delete the "designer_content" folder from your site's packages directory (but you do *not* need to uninstall the addon in the Concrete5 dashboard).
2. Click the "Downloads" button near the top of this page (scroll up a bit -- it's over to the right, under where it says "Branch:master").
3. Click "Download .zip".
4. Unzip the downloaded file.
5. Rename the unzipped folder to "designer_content".
6. Copy that designer_content folder to your site's packages directory (NOT concrete/packages).
7. Log into your site, go to Dashboard -> Add Functionality. If you are upgrading from an older version, you should see a message saying that you have upgrades available -- click that button and follow the instructions given there. If this is the first time you are installing Designer Content on your site, just click the "Install" button next to "Designer Content".
7. To begin using, go to Dashboard -> Pages and Themes, then click the "Designer Content" tab (the right-most item in the top grey bar).
